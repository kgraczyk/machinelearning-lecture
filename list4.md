## List 2

* __Problem 2.1 (20 pt.)__
 Consider wine data [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html#sklearn.datasets.load_wine)
   - split data into train and test datasets using scikit-learn split method
   - analyze data (plot relations between features 2D triangle plot)
   - plot3D of the samples, distinguish between three classes, consider various combinations of features
   - use PCA and then plot3D once again
   - use the K-means algorithm for clustering the data
   - check the accuracy of the model predictions on training and test datasets
   - prepare the presentation about data, their properties, and the results of the analysis

 * __Problem 2.2 (20 pt.)__
 Consider diabetes data [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html#sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes)
   - split data into train and test datasets using scikit-learn split method
   - analyze data (plot relations between features 2D triangle plot)
   - perform linear regression analysis
   - check the accuracy of the model predictions on training and test datasets
   - prepare the presentation about data, their properties, and results of the analysis

* __Problem 2.3 (20 pt.)__
Make the dame analysis as in Problem 2.1 but for digits data [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html#sklearn.datasets.load_digits)
   - make PCA, and then linear regression

* __Problem 2.4 (20 pt.)__
Make the dame analysis as in Problem 2.1 but for breast cancer [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer)
