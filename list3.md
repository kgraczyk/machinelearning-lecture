## List 3 (16 pt.)

### __Problem 3.0__

Use the MNIST dataset. It can be downloaded using PyTorch, Kaggle, or any other service.

### __Problem 3.1__ 

Construct a Hopfield network that stores the MNIST data patterns. Find the best patterns for every digit, namely the patterns for which the Hopfield network recognizes other types of digits most efficiently.

**Competition**

__This is a task for everyone__  
The best model, the one which is the most efficient in storing ten digits (from 0 to 9), gets 3 points, the second person gets 2 points, and the third gets 1 point. The task must be done during classes. 

### __Problem 3.2__ (2 pt.)

Solve the same problem as in Problem 3.1 but for the Hopfield network with the loss given by equation (93) from the lecture, considering training algorithm I from lecture, page 71.

### __Problem 3.3__ (2 pt.)

Solve the same problem as in Problem 3.1 but for the Hopfield network with the loss given by equation (93) from the lecture, considering training algorithm II from lecture, page 71.

### __Problem 3.4__ 
**Competition**
1st (3 pt.) 2nd (2 pt.) 3rd (1 pt.)

Use a Hopfield network to store the MNIST data. Choose the most convenient realization of the Hopfield version discussed during the lecture. Try to store as many different patterns (different digits) as possible.  The winner is the one who stores the highest number of patterns!
