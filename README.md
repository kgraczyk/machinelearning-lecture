* **Problem 1** (1pt.)

Let a Hopfield network have N nodes. How many weights does a network with symmetric connections have, and how many weights does a network with bidirectional connections have? Answer and justify with a calculation.  

* **Problem 2** (1pt.)

According to Hebb's rule, the weights of the connections in a Hopfield network are updated according to the formula:
$$
w_{ij} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{\mu=1}^p \xi^\mu_i \xi^\mu_j.
$$   
We can slightly generalize the above rule and assume that 
$$
w_{ij} = \eta \sum_{\mu=1}^p \xi^\mu_i \xi^\mu_j, \quad \eta > 0 
$$
Does the magnitude of  $\eta$ matter? Why was  $\eta=1/N$ chosen? Provide a short explanation with a calculation.
